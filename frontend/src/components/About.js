        <h1>Hi, my name is Yonatan Dudai ðŸ‘‹</h1>
        <p>
          I'm a highly motivated BSc Computer Science graduate specializing in Bioinformatics at Ben-Gurion University.
          I have strong programming skills in Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
          My academic background includes advanced algorithm design, dynamic programming, server-client architecture, and data analysis techniques.
          Additionally, I bring practical experience as a data analyst,
          where I applied MongoDB and SQL for data extraction, statistical analysis, and reporting.
